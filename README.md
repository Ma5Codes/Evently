# **Evently – Event Management System**

**Evently** is a campus-focused event management platform built as part of our group project. It simplifies event scheduling, registration, and ticket booking for university communities.

As the lead UI/UX architect, I designed and developed a modern, intuitive interface that prioritizes user experience. The system is built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), following **Agile Scrum methodology** for iterative and efficient development.
